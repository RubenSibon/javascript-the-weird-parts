# Let's Build a JavaScript Libary!

This repository represents my answer to the final assignent of Anthony Alicea's ['JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts' course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/). I took the course in 2017.

It is a great course that really helps you to understand JavaScript as a programming language. Anthony explains in a clear and accessible way what some of the scarier topics like 'closures', 'prototypes' and 'this' really mean.

He explains a lot of those concepts by looking and dissecting the code of the jQuery library which I found to be very educative and interesting. I strongly recommend any intermediary (JavaScript) programmer to dissect a popular library line by line to increase your understanding of the language.

At the end of the course you get to build your own 'mini' library of which you can inspect my solution here.

The course is recommended for intermediary JavaScript developers and programmers coming from other languages.
